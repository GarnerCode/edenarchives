                    <p>Known as the Land of Enchantment and the first known civilization on Eden, Aethia reigns supreme over Eden as
                        the capital of magic, home to the world's greatest magic-users that have revolutionized the use of
                        spells and enchantments to create new technologies such as airships and automatons, as well as the 
                        wonderous floating capital city of Celestia, guarded by Aurene, the only known crytalline dragon in existence.
                         Ruled by the last-living shardmind, Genos, Mind of Magic, the Aethian Empire has reigned 
                        since the beginning of creation. The majority of Aethia's citizens, being Elves, Tieflings, and Arakocra, 
                        possess some form of magic that is used in everyday life as a tool to further enhance their lives.

                    <p>The Krytan Kingdom, ruled under the Sera Dynasty, has stood firm as a prosperous kingdom for centuries.
                        The lands of Kryta are of the most diverse in Eden, with rolling green plains, dense forests, 
                        tall mountain ranges, deserts, and frozen tundras. The major races that inhabit Kryta are Humans, Elves,
                        and Dwarves, with Lizardfolk more common in the Avian desert. Though peace has been maintained within
                        the lands for centuries, civil war knocks on Kryta's door as Avia and Hofsa push for independence from 
                        the crown, seeking their own forms of government.

                    <img class="map" src="media/Maguuma.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Maguuma is a generally unestablished continent, with only one major city. The majority of the land is made 
                        up of dense jungles and jagged mountain peaks, including the world's largest volcano, the Shattered Peak. 
                        In the past, Maguuma was inhabited by two tribes, made up of 
                        Lizardfolk and Dragonborn: the White Owl Tribe, and the Primordial Tribe. The 
                        White Owls sought to expand Maguuma into a thriving civilization, trading with other continents and allowing 
                        Maguuman culture to be shared with the world. The Primordials, led by Dirazu, Mind of Fire, sought to keep 
                        Maguuma's nature pristine and untouched from the outer world, and declared war against the White Owls. The 
                        two tribes waged war for years, with the White Owls eventually being run off from their home temple, to 
                        the edge of the continent. After the death of Dirazu, the Primordial tribe vanished without a trace, leaving 
                        behind their great temple at the base of the Shattered Peak.

                    <img class="map" src="media/Orr.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>The forbidden land of Orr is shrouded in mystery. Plagued by deadly spellstorms, Orr has remained as a 
                        fallen continent for centuries, with very few records remaining that recall the history 
                        of the land, save for the fact that Umbra, Mind of Darkness ruled Orr. Though many believe that the spellstorms are 
                        a side-effect of Aethian mages practicing their magic in the land, there is no evidence that supports these 
                        claims, nor can this chaotic side-effect be reproduced during tests.
